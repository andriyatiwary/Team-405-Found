ML based House price prediction

Plan of Action:
Data preprocessing.
Applying ensemble methods (RandomForest, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBoost) after data cleaning.
Applying deep learning over processed data.
Comparing the accuracy of models and deciding the one with best estimates.

Conclusion:
implemented various regression models like linear regression, gradient boosting regressor, random forest, XGBoost, MLP Regressor, and sequential model
On comparing all the above mentioned models for Boston dataset it was found RandomForest gives best predictions with 81.9% accuracy.
We plan to use ensemble techniques to combine these algorithms
By feature extraction we have already taken the best three attributes, thus we would be using them as an input to our model
